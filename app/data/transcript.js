The following is a conversation with Jeff Hawkins. He's the founder of the Redwoods Center for Theoretical Neuroscience in 2002 and Numenta in 2005, in his 2004 book titled Unintelligence. And in the research before and after, he and his team have worked to reverse engineer the neocortex and propose artificial intelligence architectures, approaches and ideas that are inspired by the human brain. These ideas include hierarchical Tupper Memory, ASTM from 2004 and New Work The Thousands Brain Theory of Intelligence from 2017 18 and 19. Jeff's ideas have been an inspiration to many who have looked for progress beyond the current machine learning approaches. But they have also received criticism for lacking a body of empirical evidence supporting the models. This is always a challenge when seeking more than small, incremental steps forward. And I, Jeff, is a brilliant mind and many of the ideas he has developed and aggregated from neuroscience are worth understanding and thinking about. There are limits to deep learning as it is currently defined forward progress and AI is shrouded in mystery.My hope is that conversations like this can help provide an inspiring spark for new ideas.

And now here's my conversation with Jeff Hawkins. Are you more interested in understanding the human brain or in creating artificial systems that have many of the same qualities but don't necessarily require that you actually understand the underpinning workings of our mind? So there's a clear answer to that question. My primary interest is understanding the human brain.No question about it, but. I also firmly believe that we will not be able to create fully intelligent machines until we understand how the human brain works, so I don't see those as separate problems. I think there's limits to what can be done with machine intelligence if you don't understand the principles by which the brain works. And so I actually believe that studying the brain is actually the the fastest way to get the machine intelligence.`;
